# ClassicalSnakeGame

This is one of my first C program, just for fun. I wasn't a good programmer at that time. I'm not even a good one now, but my skill is much better now. I say this so that whoever you are, the next time you visit this project, you may see a better version of it. 

This is written in Linux environment and can only be complied in Linux environment. For Windows, you may want to modify my code using windows.h library
